Abstract:

Computational issues arise in reinforcement learning problems when the relevant state space is extremely large. In the last one to two years, there has been significant research on how to use neural networks to approximate large state spaces, for instance by Google-backed startup DeepMind Technologies. In this study, we apply a Deep Q-learning approach toward building an AI agent for the game 2048, a puzzle game that went viral in 2014. In particular, we study how specializing the neural network towards Q-learning for 2048--by altering the network's architecture, back-propagation algorithm, input features, and other properties--impacts the AI's overall performance.
